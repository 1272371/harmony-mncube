## The brief

You are consulting on new Cryptocurrency Trading start-up __*CryptoDudez*__'s Machine Learning project.

![](ethereum.jpg)

They would like to automate their Ethereum trades by making use of machine learning on a scalable and cost-effective cloud solution on either AWS or GCP and require your help in scoping out the solution architecture, as well as building a minimal proof of concept solution within 7 days.

## The data

__*CryptoDudez*__ have made use of some interns to gather historical crypto prices and have provided this to you in the archive: `cryptocurrency_historical_prices.zip`

They would like to make use of additional datasources, such as social media posts, information from news sites, as well as trading prices from stock exchanges and the value of major fiat currencies, in order to train an ML model which will predict whether to buy, sell or [HODL](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/hodl-a-typo-takes-hold-as-a-sound-cryptocurrency-strategy) their current Ethereum stockpile.

## The requirements

__*CryptoDudez*__ would like the cryptocurrency data, as well as any additional datasources to be stored in their raw form on a Data Lake layer.

Additional datasources need to be web-scraped and joined to the cryptocurrency data, based on the timestamp.

We usually scope out our project requirements in a Sprint Zero phase, where we usually come up with some solution diagrams, we'd like you to draw up an architectural diagram for your solution before you start.
